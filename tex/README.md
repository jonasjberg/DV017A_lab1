LaTeX Lab Report Template
=========================

**My own personal template file for writing reports.**

Currently using pdflatex and/or pandoc to render the .tex files to .pdf.
Feel free to use it but keep in mind I am far from proficient in LaTeX coding.
So it's on you if it doesn't work out right. Use at your own risk!

./img               images to be included in the LaTeX document 
./build             output files
```
